title: What is Otto
---




OttO defines a _system_ of well established, rock solid _Open Source_
tools to define a set modern, (approaching) 100% automated application
lifecycle infrastructure.

We want to be able to "spin up" the _infrastructure_ required to
support a production quality _application_ or _site_[1]

[1] I use terms _application_ and _site_ interchangebly.  By
_application_ or _app_, I mean an entire system that provides its
_user_ with a specific experience.  For example, I would call
_Freshbooks_ an _App_ or the network of resources it runs on, the
_site_.  Which involves, servers, databases, custom software, OTS
services and so much more.

## The Application PoV

This brings up a subtle, but very important point: we will approach
solving this **problem (todo: define problem)
