We expect things to break, we will do our best attempt to, to do an
appropriate post mortem analysis.

0. problem or feature
1. postmortem or background 
2. root cause or problem being fixed
3. fix or work around
4. update processes
5. update tests
6. automate solution

1. proactively smart logging, hopefully we capture the necessary data
   to have either prevented the problem (a fix and test), avoided the
   problem (a workaround, caveat and test) or ...?
