# otto ~ The Pluggable Micro Server ~

Otto is a very small and simple microserver that can use plugins
to provide unique functionality through routes and callbacks.

Spinning up servers for PoCs, testing or starting a new project is
a typical thing to do these days [era of the
micro-service](http://wikipedia.org/microservices) .
